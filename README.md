Bottleneck
========================

Visualizing Trello boards in cumulative flow diagrams: an incomplete-work-in-progress-proof-of-concept-side-project.

Bottleneck (in theory) allows users to

* connect to their Trello accounts
* import boards and card statistics
* track and visualize cumulative flow over time

Note: hosted heroku app only runs statistics on an hourly basis so initial results will blank. That's what you get for free hosting.

Built with

* Ruby/Rails
* Ember.js
* CoffeeScript
* Redis
* Postgresql
* d3.js
* memcached
